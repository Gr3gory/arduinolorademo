# Arduino LoRa Demo
An educational demo for work with LoRa and Arduino. \
This project sends data across LoRa beetween two Arduino MKR WAN 1310.
The transmitter collects data from a distance sensor and sends them to a
receiver wich plots the data on 3 LEDs

## Installation
Clone this repo \
Prepare the two Arduino MKR WAN 1310 with antennae \
Install the drivers \
Add the arduino-LoRa library .zip file to the IDE \
Flash one arduino at a time or use two separate PCs
